    "# Notebook 05 · Anomaly Detection on Hourly Brand Funnels\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds the **anomaly detection layer** for FunnelPulse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the historical **hourly funnel metrics by brand** generated in the batch pipeline, it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learns typical conversion behavior for each brand (and for each brand at each hour of day)\n",
    "- Scores each hour’s conversion rate against those baselines\n",
    "- Flags statistically unusual hours as **anomalies** (drops or spikes)\n",
    "- Writes a dedicated anomalies table for downstream reporting and investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "This closes the loop from “we have metrics” to “we can surface incidents that need attention.”\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## High Level Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize Spark and project paths\n",
    "2. Load the batch hourly brand funnel table\n",
    "3. Filter for reliable windows (sufficient volume)\n",
    "4. Derive additional features:\n",
    "   - Hour of day\n",
    "5. Compute baselines:\n",
    "   - Per brand across all hours\n",
    "   - Per brand × hour_of_day\n",
    "6. Compute anomaly scores using z-scores\n",
    "7. Flag significant drops and spikes as anomalies\n",
    "8. Write anomalies into a dedicated gold table\n",
    "9. Inspect and sort anomalies to understand the most severe incidents\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Preparation and Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid noisy, low traffic windows distorting results, the notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reads the full `gold_funnel_hourly_brand` table\n",
    "- Keeps only brand-hour windows that meet basic volume criteria, for example:\n",
    "  - A minimum number of views in that hour\n",
    "- Adds `hour_of_day` (0–23) extracted from `window_start`\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a focused dataset where anomaly scores are more meaningful and less driven by random fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Baseline Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "The anomaly logic uses **simple but robust statistical baselines** derived directly from the hourly funnel table:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Per-brand baseline**\n",
    "\n",
    "   For each brand, the notebook computes, across all hours in the historical data:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `conv_mean_brand` = average conversion rate\n",
    "   - `conv_std_brand`  = standard deviation of conversion rate\n",
    "\n",
    "   This captures how the brand typically converts overall, regardless of time of day.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Per-brand, per-hour-of-day baseline**\n",
    "\n",
    "   For each brand and each hour of day (0–23), it computes:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `conv_mean_brand_hour` = average conversion rate at that hour\n",
    "   - `conv_std_brand_hour`  = standard deviation of conversion rate at that hour\n",
    "\n",
    "   This captures daily patterns (for example, evenings vs mornings) and allows more precise comparisons when enough data is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both sets of baselines are computed using window functions so they scale over the full dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anomaly Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "For every hourly brand window, the notebook computes **z-scores** that measure how far the current conversion rate deviates from its baseline:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `z_brand`      = (current conversion − brand mean) / brand std\n",
    "- `z_brand_hour` = (current conversion − brand-hour mean) / brand-hour std\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle edge cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a standard deviation is zero or null (e.g., very few observations), the corresponding z-score is set to 0 so it does not trigger anomalies.\n",
    "- An additional view count threshold is applied (for example, `views >= 50`) so that only windows with sufficient traffic are considered for anomaly decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This produces two independent anomaly signals per window (brand level and brand×hour level).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anomaly Flagging and Labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook then converts z-scores into human consumable anomaly flags:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Drop anomaly**\n",
    "  - Marked when:\n",
    "    - The window has enough views, and\n",
    "    - Either `z_brand` or `z_brand_hour` falls below a negative threshold (e.g., −2.0)\n",
    "  - Interpreted as: “conversion is significantly lower than expected for this brand, or for this brand at this hour of day.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spike anomaly**\n",
    "  - Marked when:\n",
    "    - The window has enough views, and\n",
    "    - Either `z_brand` or `z_brand_hour` exceeds a positive threshold (e.g., +2.0)\n",
    "  - Interpreted as: “conversion is significantly higher than expected.”\n",
    "\n",
    "An `anomaly_type` field is derived with values such as `\"drop\"`, `\"spike\"`, or `NULL` when no anomaly is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure makes it easy to filter and rank incidents by severity (`z_brand` or `z_brand_hour`), and to build lists of “top 20 worst drops” or “largest positive spikes.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anomaly Table Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "All anomaly rows are written to `tables/gold_anomalies_hourly_brand`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each record includes:\n",
    "  - Time window (`window_start`, `window_end`, `window_date`)\n",
    "  - Brand and original funnel metrics\n",
    "  - Baseline statistics (`conv_mean_brand`, `conv_std_brand`, etc.)\n",
    "  - Z-scores (`z_brand`, `z_brand_hour`)\n",
    "  - Anomaly flags and type\n",
    "- The table is partitioned by `window_date` to support efficient time-based queries and visualization tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "This table serves as the primary source for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alert lists\n",
    "- Incident dashboards\n",
    "- Post-incident root cause analysis workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Role of This Notebook in the Overall System\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the full FunnelPulse architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notebooks 01 and 02:\n",
    "  - Build the batch lakehouse:\n",
    "    - Bronze → Silver → multiple gold metrics (hourly, daily, by brand, category, price band)\n",
    "- Notebook 03:\n",
    "  - Prepares a file-based streaming input from historical bronze events\n",
    "- Notebook 04:\n",
    "  - Runs a Spark Structured Streaming job to compute hourly brand funnel metrics in near real time\n",
    "- Notebook 05 (this notebook):\n",
    "  - Adds a statistical anomaly detection layer on top of the hourly funnel metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these components form an end-to-end system that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ingests and cleans large-scale event data\n",
    "2. Produces both batch and streaming funnel KPIs\n",
    "3. Automatically surfaces **when** and **where** funnel behavior becomes unusual\n",
    "\n",
    "This elevates the project from “reporting metrics” to **proactive funnel monitoring and incident detection** — exactly the goal of FunnelPulse."
